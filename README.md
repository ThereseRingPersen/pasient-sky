# PASIENT-SKY

In this small program I have made a function that returns the available time in the person(s) calender.

## Available time function

The function returns

- available time in the calendar, where the time requested is smaller then the available time in the available intervals. This is done by process of elimination.
- time slots, where I have used the calendarId and the timeslotTypeId to select time slots to return.

## Script to run the program is

npm run start:dev
